# Temelio Phone Screen

## Overview

At Temelio, we are supercharging the effectiveness of the nonprofit community by building software to simplify the grant making workflow.

We are focusing on foundations as our initial customer. A foundation is a nonprofit entity that managements money on behalf of an individual or corporation. A foundation size is measured by the money it manages. The more money the foundation manages, the larger it is.

## Problem

Large foundations tend to distribute money to several hundreds of nonprofits within a year. For legal reasons, the foundation needs to formally email each nonprofit a message that contains the nonprofit's name, the address, and the current date.

As you can imagine, it is tedious for foundations to manually create a personalized email for each nonprofit they distribute money to. We want to help make their process easier by building API endpoints to manage this workflow.

Your task is to create a backend API that can do the following:

- Allows someone to create nonprofits and their metadata (name, address, and email)
- Allows someone to customize an email in the API request to bulk send to a list of nonprofits with a templated message (i.e. "Sending money to nonprofit { name } at address { address }") and have the templated fields populated with the correct data
- Allows someone to retrieve all the emails that have been sent to nonprofits


You can make the following assumptions

- Application does not need any authentication
- Email is a unique identifier for nonprofits
- Assume the data passed into the API endpoints will be valid (i.e. you don't need to check for bad request data)

The backend should persist the data (in-memory is sufficient). For sending email, you typically would rely on using a third-party email sending client such as sendgrid. However, in this exercise, simply mock the email client on the backend.

## Deliverable

We want you to solve this solution with any language on the backend. Feel free to use any libraries or frameworks you feel comfortable with.
